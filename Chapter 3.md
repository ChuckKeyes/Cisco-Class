1. Which of the following terms is not commonly used to describe a serial link? 
	1. Private line 
	2. Point-to-point link 
	3. Leased circuit 
	4. **E-line**
2. Two routers, R1 and R2, connect using an Ethernet WAN service. The service provides point-to-point service between these two routers only, as a Layer 2 Ethernet service. Which of the following are the most likely to be true about this WAN? (Choose two answers.) 
	1. R1 will connect to a physical Ethernet link, with the other end of the cable connected to R2. 
	2. **R1 will connect to a physical Ethernet link, with the other end of the cable connected to a device at the WAN service provider point of presence.** 
	3. R1 will forward data-link frames to R2 using an HDLC header/trailer. 
	4. **R1 will forward data-link frames to R2 using an Ethernet header/trailer.**
	
3. Imagine a network in which PC1 connects to the same Ethernet LAN as Router1, PC2 connects to the same LAN as Router2, and the two routers connect to each other with a PPP serial link. When PC1 sends data to PC2, and Router1 removes the Ethernet header and trailer, which of the following is true? 
	1. **Router1 does not use the removed Ethernet header/trailer again.** 
	2. Router1 re-encapsulates the packet in a PPP frame that uses the Ethernet addresses from the removed header. 
	3. Router1 also removes the IP header before forwarding the data to Router2. 
	4. Router1 re-encapsulates the packet in a new Ethernet frame before forwarding the packet to Router2.

4. Which of the following does a router normally use when making a decision about routing TCP/IP packets? 
	1. Destination MAC address 
	2. Source MAC address 
	3. **Destination IP address** 
	4. Source IP address 
	5. Destination MAC and IP addresses

5. Which of the following are true about a LAN-connected TCP/IP host and its IP routing (forwarding) choices? 
	1. The host always sends packets to its default gateway. 
	2. The host never sends packets to its default gateway. 3. 
	3. **The host sends packets to its default gateway if the destination IP address is in a different subnet than the host.** 
	4. The host sends packets to its default gateway if the destination IP address is in the same subnet as the host.

6. Which of the following are functions of a routing protocol? (Choose two answers.) 
	1. **Advertising known routes to neighboring routers** 
	2. Learning routes to directly connected subnets 
	3. **Learning routes as advertised to the router by neighboring routers** 
	4. Forwarding IP packets based on a packet’s destination IP address

7. A company implements a TCP/IP network, with PC1 sitting on an Ethernet LAN. Which of the following protocols and features requires PC1 to learn information from some other server device? 
	1. ARP 
	2. ping 3. 
	3. **DNS** 
	4. None of these answers are correct.
